  <h1>Entry Fees & Payment</h1>
  <p>To participate in premium FX Arena tournaments, you must pay a registration fee using one of the available payment methods.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All deposits are made to your registered real account.</li>
    <li>Registration fees are automatically deducted from your real account for the selected tournament.</li>
    <li>Refunds are only processed if the tournament is canceled or postponed by FX Arena administration.</li>
    <li>Ensure your account details are correct before payment to avoid delays.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The registration fee you pay for premium tournaments is used to fund the tournament prize pool. 
    All participants’ fees are combined, and rewards are distributed to winners according to the prize structure.
